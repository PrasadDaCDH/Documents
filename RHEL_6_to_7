Procedure
1.	Ensure that your system is registered to Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM).
2.	Ensure that you have access to the latest RHEL 6 content. If you use the yum-plugin-versionlock plug-in to lock packages to a specific version, clear the lock:
# yum versionlock clear
3.	Enable the Extras repository, which contains necessary packages for a pre-upgrade assessment and an in-place upgrade.
For the Server variant on the 64-bit Intel architecture on server edition:
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-extras-rpms --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms
4.	Install the Preupgrade Assistant and Red Hat Upgrade Tool:
# yum install preupgrade-assistant preupgrade-assistant-el6toel7 redhat-upgrade-tool
5.	Update all packages to their latest RHEL 6 version:
# yum update
6.	Reboot the system:
# reboot
7.	Back up all your data before performing the upgrade to prevent potential data loss.
8.	Verify that you are registered with the Red Hat Subscription Manager:
# yum update
The Loaded plug-ins: entry must contain subscription-manager.
9.	Verify that only supported package groups are installed:
# yum grouplist

2.	View the assessment report in greater detail by opening the HTML file with results in a web browser:
# web_browser file:///root/preupgrade/result.html
12.	View the README file in the /root/preupgrade/ directory for more information about the output directory structure, exit codes, and risk explanations associated with the Preupgrade Assistant utility.
13.	Resolve problems found by the Preupgrade Assistant during the assessment by following the Remediation text in the report.
14.	Run the Preupgrade Assistant again. If there are no new problems to be resolved, you can proceed with upgrading your system.
15.	Now locate the iso image file and note the path 

16.	Disable active repositories to prevent problems with combining packages from different major releases of RHEL.
