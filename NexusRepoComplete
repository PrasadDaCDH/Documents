Life Cycle of the Applicaiton packages:
source File --> Binar file ---> Create a packakage ---> Archive in a repo ----> Download and upload
code file --> class file ---> package jar file --> Nexus ---> upload and download


Repository Management Systems
types:
1>Central : Can be accessed by anyone (Docker Hub,Google play store, yum repository)
2>Private: For internal use in the organiasation (Nexus,Jfrog,Archiva)
3>Local: on the system (m2 in maven)

What is Nexus?
It is Repository Manager
(it does not version the source code )
versioning is ment for packages
nexus has Universal support for all popular build tools for packages

Prequisites:
JRE + JDK 8
Memory 4GB
CPU 2


How to install?

Step 1: 
Do prequisite of installing JAVA and JDK 8

Step 2:
Download the Nexus OSS package from
https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/product-information/download

With Registration
https://www.sonatype.com/products/repository-oss-download

Step 3:
Untar the file

tar -zxvf

cd nexus
cd etc
Go nexus-deafault.properties
(understand this)

cd bin
./nexus start

Step 4:
Login
Click Sign in> get the admin passwd


Step 5:
go for authentication

Go to seeting:
go to roles and user and create them

Types of Repos types:
1>Hosted : for internal use
2>Proxy : it has Cache
3>Group : For both for central repo

Step 6:
Types of Repo in Maven:
Release 
Snapshot

Go to settings > Create the Repository (for hosted maven for releaese)
get the centreal repo for maven

Now useing that url create an proxy repository for maven for snapshot or release

Now create a gruop for Maven
and add all the repos
=====================================
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bMTUjuI5eU

mvn -version

Step 1:
Create Maven repo 
Maven 2 proxy
Give a name
give a link for Default repository
and create it 

Step 2:
IF you want maven to point to your repo 
then go to 
1>.m2
>create setting.xml file
touch settings.xml

add following:

 | This is the configuration file for Maven. It can be specified at two levels:
 |
 |  1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user,
 |                 and is normally provided in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -s /path/to/user/settings.xml
 |
 |  2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all Maven
 |                 users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same Maven
 |                 installation). It's normally provided in
 |                 ${maven.conf}/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -gs /path/to/global/settings.xml
 |
 | The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start at
 | getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate, the default
 | values (values used when the setting is not specified) are provided.

  <servers>
    <!-- server
     | Specifies the authentication information to use when connecting to a particular server, identified by
     | a unique name within the system (referred to by the 'id' attribute below).
     |
     | NOTE: You should either specify username/password OR privateKey/passphrase, since these pairings are

  </servers>

  <!-- mirrors
   | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
   |
   | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.
   | However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
   | it to several places.
   |
   | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
   | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
   | server for that repository.
   |-->
  <mirrors>
    <!-- mirror
     | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository. The repository that
     | this mirror serves has an ID that matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used
     | for inheritance and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.
     |
    <mirror>
      <id>mirrorId</id>
      <mirrorOf>repositoryId</mirrorOf>
      <name>Human Readable Name for this Mirror.</name>
      <url>http://my.repository.com/repo/path</url>
    </mirror>
     -->
  </mirrors>

  <!-- profiles
   | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
   | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
   | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
   |
   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where
   | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is
   | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.
   |
   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles
   | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially
   | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,
   | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a
   | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.
   | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
   |
   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
   |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
   |       variables for plugins in the POM.
   |
   |-->
  <profiles>
    <!-- profile
     | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the
     | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/>
     | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
     |
     | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention
     | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.
     | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting
     | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.
     |
     | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.
    <profile>
      <id>jdk-1.4</id>
      <activation>
        <jdk>1.4</jdk>
      </activation>
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>jdk14</id>
          <name>Repository for JDK 1.4 builds</name>
          <url>http://www.myhost.com/maven/jdk14</url>
          <layout>default</layout>
          <snapshotPolicy>always</snapshotPolicy>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
    </profile>
    -->

    <!--
     | Here is another profile, activated by the system property 'target-env' with a value of 'dev',
     | which provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance. To use this, your plugin configuration
     | might hypothetically look like:
     |
     | ...
     | <plugin>
     |   <groupId>org.myco.myplugins</groupId>
     |   <artifactId>myplugin</artifactId>
     |
     |   <configuration>
     |     <tomcatLocation>${tomcatPath}</tomcatLocation>
     |   </configuration>
     | </plugin>
     | ...
     |
     | NOTE: If you just wanted to inject this configuration whenever someone set 'target-env' to
     |       anything, you could just leave off the <value/> inside the activation-property.
     |
	 -->
    <profile>
      <id>env-dev</id>

      <activation>
        <property>
          <name>target-env</name>

Then remove:
Server configurations:
We want all should be able to download from the repository

Step 3:
Take the url from the Nexus repo you want and put it into the 
Mirror attribute.

It will be downloading from here only for the repos
if it is not present it will be downloading from the public repos and
save it.

Step 4:
Allow anonymus user to access to allow
Do
mvn clean install 
(it will download all to the proxy of maven)

Go to browse and check your repo you created.

step 5:
we also need a repo to store what we have done.

edit the pom.xml:

=================================================================================
Change the Distribution Management and Snapshot repository

Step 6:
Now we need to create 2 diffrent repos for Realease and Snapshot repos
